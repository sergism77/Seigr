# Seigr Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders of the Seigr community, pledge to foster an inclusive, ethical, and welcoming environment for everyone, free from harassment and discrimination. We are committed to building a community that embraces diversity across age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, and sexual orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to a positive, symbiotic ecosystem, supporting mutual respect, openness, and eco-conscious innovation in all our collaborations.

## Our Standards

### Positive Behaviors
To create an environment aligned with Seigr’s values of ecological integrity, ethical collaboration, and decentralized inclusivity, we promote:

- **Empathy and Kindness**: Engage with others thoughtfully and compassionately.
- **Respect for Diverse Perspectives**: Value and consider differing opinions, knowledge levels, and experiences.
- **Constructive Feedback**: Offer feedback that is supportive and focuses on growth, learning, and improvement.
- **Responsibility and Accountability**: Own up to mistakes, seek to make amends, and learn to improve.
- **Community-Oriented Focus**: Act with a commitment to the health, growth, and resilience of the Seigr community.

### Unacceptable Behaviors
We do not tolerate behaviors that undermine Seigr’s mission of ethical, eco-conscious, and collaborative engagement. Prohibited actions include:
