## Getting Started

To contribute to Seigr, it‚Äôs beneficial to familiarize yourself with:
- **Decentralized Systems**: Knowledge of distributed networks, consensus protocols, and peer-to-peer architectures.
- **Cryptographic Standards**: Understanding hashing, encryption, and decentralized identity protocols will help when working on Seigr's secure layers.
- **Eco-Inspired Computing**: Seigr‚Äôs architecture follows nature-inspired principles, like self-healing and decentralized intelligence inspired by mycelium networks.

Whether you‚Äôre interested in developing new protocol buffers, optimizing data redundancy, or refining user interfaces, all contributions are welcome!

### Joining the Contributor Team

1. **Review the Issues Board**: Check [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Seigr-lab/Seigr-EcoSystem/issues) for areas where contributions are most needed. 
2. **Join Discussions**: Participate in our community discussions, especially if you‚Äôre proposing significant changes. 
3. **Fork the Repository**: Start with a fork of the Seigr repo to work on changes independently.
4. **Introduce Yourself**: Feel free to introduce yourself in the `#contributions` channel on Discord and outline your areas of interest.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Python** (3.8 or higher)
- **Protocol Buffers Compiler** (`protoc`)
- **Conda** for environment management

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository** (including submodules; see next section):
   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Seigr-lab/Seigr-EcoSystem.git
   cd Seigr-EcoSystem
   ```

2. **Set up the Development Environment**:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate seigr
   ```

3. **Build Protocol Buffers**:
   - From the project root, build all protocol buffers:
     ```bash
     protoc --proto_path=seigr_protocol --python_out=src/ seigr_protocol/**/*.proto
     ```

4. **Run Tests**:
   - Ensure your environment is set up correctly by running the initial tests.
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover -s src/tests
   ```

## Cloning the Repository and Submodules

Since **seigr-os** is a **submodule**, you must use the correct cloning method to avoid missing dependencies.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Cloning for the First Time (Recommended)**
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Seigr-lab/Seigr-EcoSystem.git
cd Seigr-EcoSystem
```
This ensures all submodules, including `seigr-os`, are cloned properly.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ If You've Already Cloned the Repo**
If you previously cloned the repo **without** `--recurse-submodules`, run:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
This initializes and fetches all submodules.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Keeping Submodules Updated**
To update the submodules after a pull:
```bash
git pull --recurse-submodules
git submodule update --recursive --remote
```
This ensures you always have the latest submodule changes.

## Contribution Guidelines

### Areas of Focus

Seigr benefits from contributions in various areas:
- **Protocol Buffers Development**: Expand Seigr‚Äôs modularity by contributing to protocol files in `seigr_protocol/`.
- **Eco-Friendly Encoding**: Explore senary encoding methods for energy-efficient storage and transmission.
- **AI-Driven Analytics**: Implement predictive maintenance, anomaly detection, and adaptive scaling.
- **Self-Healing Mechanisms**: Design and improve replication strategies for fault tolerance.
- **Community Documentation**: Help document the technical architecture and eco-inspired computing principles.
- **Security & Identity**: Work on secure identity management, access control, and cryptographic protocols.

### **Committing Changes to the Submodule**
Since `seigr-os` is a submodule, changes inside it must be committed separately.

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Making Changes in `seigr-os`**
```bash
cd seigr-os
git checkout development  # Ensure you're on the correct branch
git pull origin development  # Get latest changes
# Make your edits
git commit -am "Your commit message"
git push origin development
```

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Updating the Submodule Reference in the Main Repo**
After committing to `seigr-os`, return to the main repository:
```bash
cd ..
git add seigr-os
git commit -m "Updated seigr-os submodule reference"
git push origin development
```
This updates the reference to the latest commit in `seigr-os`.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Branch Naming**: Use descriptive branch names, e.g., `feature/smart-contract-protocol` or `fix/resource-management`.
2. **Commit Messages**: Use clear and concise commit messages. Example:
   ```plaintext
   feat(protocol): Add adaptive scaling configuration to resource_management.proto
   ```
3. **Pull Request Title**: Briefly describe your PR, e.g., ‚ÄúAdd AI-Driven Analysis and Prediction Protocol.‚Äù
4. **Description**: Include details, such as the purpose of the change, which issues it addresses, and specific design choices.
5. **Link to Issues**: If your PR resolves an open issue, include `Closes #issue_number` in the PR description.

### **Pull Request Checklist**
When submitting a PR, ensure you have:
- [ ] Followed coding guidelines
- [ ] Updated submodules (if applicable)
- [ ] Passed all CI/CD checks
- [ ] Provided detailed descriptions and testing evidence
